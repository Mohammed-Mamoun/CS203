    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round,
         prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked 
         on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter.
